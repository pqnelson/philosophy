*** 1. Homonyms, Synonyms, and Derivatives
- *Puzzle:* How are things named (together)?
- *Definition.*
  Things are said to be named {{{dfn(equivocally)}}} when, though they
  have a common name, the definition corresponding with the name differs
  for each.
  
  The same word is being used but they have different meanings.
  
- Examples:
  In English, "seal" means the stamp on a piece of paper. It could also
  refer to a sea animal. There's also the act of "sealing" or "closing"
  something. All these things have the same word, to mean different
  things.

  Aristotle gives a real man, and a (stick) figure in a
  picture. Although we can call the stick figure a human, only the
  living breathing human being is an animal.
- *Definition.*
  On the other hand, things are said to be named {{{dfn(univocally)}}}
  which have both the name and the definition answering to the name in
  common.
  
  We have a single word, and they signify the "same" thing (but not
  "identical" things).
- Examples:
  In a library, there are many /books/. But the books are not
  identical. So the definition of /book/ is univocal, even though they
  are not identical.
  
  You are a human being, and I am a human being, but we are both
  different (not identical) people.
  
  Aristotle's example: a man and an ox are both "animals", but they are
  not identical animals. A man is not an ox. If we were to state
  explicitly in what sense a man is an animal, we would find common
  criteria for the ox, but there are unique qualities to the human
  (e.g., the ability to conquer the world) the ox lacks.
- *Definition.*
  Things are said to be named {{{dfn(derivatively)}}}, which derive
  their name from some other name, but differ from it in termination.
  
  (This makes more sense in Greek than in English.)
- Examples:
  Aristotle's examples are the grammarian derives his name from
  "grammar", and the courageous man from the word "courage".
  
  The librarian derives from "library".
  
  Thus the grammarian derives his name from the word 'grammar', and the
  courageous man from the word 'courage'.
  
  "Healthy" is used loosely in this sense. Is it healthy to have a job?
  Yes, but "healthy" here is used in the sense of "good", not "bodily
  health".
- *Observation.*
  Aristotle is not introducing these terms to describe words, but
  things.
*** 2. Simple and Composite Expressions
- Caution: this section requires careful study, review Sadler's [[https://youtu.be/uovL2aX43Zk?t=19m57s][lectures]]
- Aristotle introduces four distinct phrases here, very
  implicitly. His concern is largely /ontological/, I think
  distinguishing between "components" of a thing from "properties" of a
  thing. (A person's kidney is "different" than a person's wisdom.)
  There is also an ambient notion of "subject" we should first clarify
  before continuing.
- *Definition.* A {{{dfn(subject)}}} (Gk: ὑποκείμενον, /hypokeimenon/)
  is an individual "substance" or "thing".
  
  Truthfully, Aristotle /does not/ define this term, but uses it in this
  manner.
- *Definition.* To be {{{dfn(predicable of a subject)}}} (or simply
  {{{dfn(predicable)}}}) means it can
  be said in such a way that it is conveying some intelligible
  information about what that subject is, or the manner in which it
  is. (What can be communicated forms the bulk of the /Categories/.) JJ
  Ackrill translates {{{term(predicable of a subject)}}} as "said of a
  subject".
  - To paraphrase Sadler's lecture, {{{term(predicable of)}}} appears to
    mean what is said of a subject reflecting "what" the subject /is/, or
    more precisely, what categories the subject /belongs to/. I suppose it
    would be anachronistic (but tempting) to identify this as analogous
    to set membership (the "∈" operator) --- i.e., "/Y/ is predicable of
    /x/" is *analogous* to "/x/ ∈ /Y/".
  - More precisely, if "/Y/ is {{{term(predicable)}}} of /x/", then "/x/
    is /Y/" is a proposition.
  - This appears to be a binary relation, "/x/ is {{{term(predicable)}}}
    of /y/". Is it transitive? (If /x/ is {{{term(predicable)}}} of /y/,
    and /y/ {{{term(predicable)}}} of /z/, is /x/ {{{term(predicable)}}}
    of /z/?)
    
    Aristotle argues in the next chapter (1b10--16) that "man is
    predicated of the individual man, and animal of man; so animal will
    be predicated of the individual man also---for the individual man is
    both a man and an animal."
- *Definition.*
  The notion of being {{{dfn(present in a subject)}}} (or just
  {{{dfn(present in)}}}, Aristotle
  clarifies he does not mean "present as parts are present in a
  whole". Instead Aristotle means "being incapable of existence apart
  from the said subject".
  - This is either circular or vague. Ackrill's translation states the
    definition as "By ‘in a subject’ I mean what is in something, not as
    a part, and cannot exist separately from what it is in". We need to
    define 'in' (as in "what it is in"), which Aristotle does not, or it
    uses the definition we're trying to define...i.e., it's
    circular. Either way, it's bad news.
    
    (NB: the cited translation adopts a convention most scholars have
    agreed upon, which is unfortunately not explicitly stated in a
    footnote, or warning, or any other mechanism in the text.)
  - Is this a binary relation? What properties does it have? It's
    clearly not symmetric (green is {{{term(present in)}}} grass, but
    grass is not {{{term(present in)}}} green). Is it transitive?
    Reflexive? 
  - Consider knowledge. Where does it exist? We could say "Well, it
    exists in books" or "It exists in my mind". Both are
    correct. Without any books, or minds, or (ostensibly) websites,
    there could be no knowledge. Knowledge /must/ be 
    {{{term(present in a subject)}}}.
  
    A similar argument goes for color. The color "green" exists in the
    grass, i.e., is {{{term(present in a subject)}}}.
  - The [[https://books.google.com/books?id=UXP5AQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA839&ots=yL15MYzPnM&dq=aristotle%20categories%20%221a20-21%22&pg=PA839#v=onepage&q=aristotle%20categories%20%221a20-21%22&f=false][Dictionary of Untranslatables: A Philosophical Lexicon]]
    claims the first place this term is used appears to be the phrase
    "Of things themselves some are predicable of a subject, and are
    never present in a subject" [τῶν ὄντων τὰ μὲν καθ' ὑποκειμένου
    τινὸς λέγεται, ἐν ὑποκειμένῳ δὲ οὐδενί ἐστιν]. (/Categories/,
    1a20-21). It should be noted "ἐν ὑποκειμένῳ" is the Greek phrase
    translated to {{{term(present in [ἐν] a subject [ὑποκειμένῳ])}}},
    which really has the connotation "in something that underlies"
    (c.f., [[http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/14058/1/14058.pdf][/Habent sua fata libelli/: Aristotle's Categories in the
    first century BC]], bottom of pg 10, plus fn 55). In the same paper,
    the author points out the phrase /καθ’ ὑποκειμένου/ which is
    translated to {{{term(predicable of a subject)}}} has the
    connotation "apply to [καθ’] something that underlies [ὑποκειμένου]".
  - *Question:*
    Is this {{{term(present in)}}} relation the same as the "parthood"
    relation in formal [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereology][Mereology]]? (See also the [[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mereology/][Stanford Online Encylopedia entry]].)
    
    The answer appears to be, at least etymologically, /no/. The
    "inseperability" condition /prevents/ this from being mere
    mereology. We should think of this as, if we look at a brown horse,
    we say "Brown is {{{term(present in)}}} that particular horse".
  - We can clarify the criteria /A/ {{{term(present in)}}} /B/ iff
    1. /A/ is in /B/, or /A/ is of /B/, or /A/ belongs to /B/, or /B/
       has /A/, or ...
    2. /A/ is not a part of /B/ in a mereological sense
    3. /A/ is inseperable from /B/
- One "class" of "things" are {{{term(predicable of a subject)}}} but
  are never {{{term(present in a subject)}}}.
  - Examples:
    If we are calling someone "knowledgeable", we are predicating
    "knowledge" /in/ that person.
    
    More general template: /X/ is {{{term(predicable of)}}} a subject if
    we can say "That subject is /X/". For example, fixing the subject to
    be Socrates, "Socrates is /X/" where /X/ could be: human, animal,
    white.
  - These are going to be called {{{term(universal substances)}}} later on.
- A second class of "things" are never {{{term(predicable of a subject)}}}
  but are {{{term(present in a subject)}}}.
  - Example:
    Someone may be knowledgeable, but /knowledge/ itself is never 
    {{{term(predicable of a subject)}}}. Instances of knowledge on
    particular topics are "in" a person's brain, but /all/ of knowledge
    is not. So /knowledge of English grammar/ is in this second class.

  - Example:
    this shade of green my particular lawn has on this fine morning.

  - These are going to be called {{{term(individual non-substances)}}}
- A third class of "things" are both {{{term(predicable of a subject)}}}
  and {{{term(present in a subject)}}}.
  - Examples: knowledge, white.
  - These are called {{{term(universal non-substances)}}}
- The last class are neither {{{term(predicable of a subject)}}}
  nor {{{term(present in a subject)}}}.
  - Example: this man, that horse, my copy of Aristotle's /Organon/.
  - These are {{{term(individual substances)}}}
- *Puzzle.* We have two binary relations, {{{term(predicable of)}}} and
  {{{term(present in)}}}. What is the underlying sets or types on which
  these relations are defined? (Obviously, subjects, but is "Man is
  {{{term(present in)}}} green" meaningful? We should think not, but
  /why/?)
  
*** 3. Concerning Predicates
- Aristotle argues that {{{term(predicable)}}} is a transitive relation.
- *Definition.* A {{{term(species)}}} (Gk: εἶδος, /eidos/) is a set or a class
  of "things".
  - /Remark/. The word /eidos/ coincidentally is Plato's term for "Form".
  - /Caution:/ *do not* confuse this term with the modern use of the
    term "species", which appears in biology and (oddly enough)
    mathematics. They are completely unrelated to Aristotle's
    {{{term(species)}}}.
- *Puzzle.* How do we /specify/ a species?
- Aristotle provides a framework for "intensional definitions" of the
  form "A [species] is a [genus] such that [differentiae]". Species then
  have a hierarchical structure, like a tree. That is, we should think
  of {{{term(genus)}}} as an underlying species which we refine using
  predicates or {{{term(differentiae)}}}. The
  {{{term(differentiae)}}} is not {{{term(present in)}}} a subject,
  Aristotle tells us in chapter 5 (3a21).
- *Caution/Danger:* I may be blurring lines here, supposing that a 
  {{{term(genus)}}}
  /is/ a {{{term(species)}}}.
  It may be the case that I am in error here, but no one
  appears to discuss this anywhere. If we were programming this up in,
  say, haskell, I would probably attempt something like the following:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  species :: * --- species is a type
  predicate :: thing -> boolean

  definition :: species -> [predicates] -> species
  definition genus differentiae = ... 
  #+END_SRC
- If we have two {{{term(species)}}}, say animal and human, then what is
  predicable of animal is also predicable of human /because/ of this
  tree-like structure relating them.


*** 4. The Eight Categories of the Objects of Thought
- Aristotle asserts "of things said without any combination", i.e.,
  subjects, each "signifies" one of ten categories:
  1. Substance (e.g., man, horse)
  2. Quantity (e.g., four-foot, five-foot)
  3. Qualification (e.g., white, grammatical)
  4. Relative (e.g., double, half, larger)
  5. Where or place (e.g., in the school, in the market)
  6. When or time (e.g., yesterday, last year)
  7. Being-in-position (e.g., is-lying, is-sitting)
  8. Having or state (e.g., has-shoes-on, has-armor-on)
  9. Doing or action (e.g., cutting, burning)
  10. Being-affected (e.g., being-cut, being-burned)
- What's the deal? Why are there 10 categories when there are 8
  categories of the object of thought? Well, it turns out that
  being-in-position and state are not objects of thought. (See
  Aristotle's /Metaphysics/ 5.7.1017a7-b9)
- We can form "affirmations" by combining two "things said" together,
  e.g. "man" and "white" produces the affirmation "man is white".
  So this sketches out how to assemble a proposition, which Aristotle
  will approach in /On Interpretations/: we build it out of "things
  said", which we can better understand using categories. But first,
  lets digress on a few remarks about the translation.
**** Remarks on Translation
- These notes are taken from Ackrill's notes on his translation. I
  myself can neither read nor speak Greek (but I can write the
  alphabet!)...so I cannot independently verify Ackrill's comments,
  aside from using Google translate and Wiktionary to see what happens.
- *Substance.*
  The Greek word is the /noiun/ from the verb "to be". So "being" or
  "entity" would be a literal equivalent. But "substance" has been
  grandfathered into this particular Aristotlian category.
- *Quantity.*
  The Greek word serves as both an interrogative and as an indefinite
  adjective (Latin, /quantum/). Only twice does Aristotle use the
  abstract noun for quantity, neither times occurs in the /Categories/.
  Instead, this translates to the interrogative adjective.
- *Qualification.*
  As an abstract noun, 'quality' is used in chapter 8 and distinguishes
  between qualities and things qualified. But as an
  interrogative adjective, 'qualification' or 'qualified' is used.
- *Relatives.*
  The Greek for this is /ta pros ti/ (τὰ πρός τι) which literally means
  "things toward something" (c.f., discussin in [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-categories/#Relatives][Stanford Encyclopedia]]).
